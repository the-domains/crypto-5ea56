            <description><![CDATA[<h1><strong>What is Blockchain?</strong></h1>,<p>Bitcoin is being touted as a possible new economic foundation, but what is actually making Bitcoin and other crypto currencies work? You might have heard about something called the blockchain. To cut it short a blockchain is a public ledger distributed across a decentralized network of computers.</p>,<p>In this post I have tried to collect a number of useful whitepapers, articles and blogs explaining the Blockchain concept. I hope you will find it useful and learn a thing or two about blockchain technology</p>,<p>The article below from CoinDesk is a good guide for people who wants to know more about bitcoin and blockchain. In the end of this article CoinDesk have provided a number of very useful links for diving deeper into the crypto world.</p>,<article><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8a1032d7a6d3522402221aba28df9500ac5388b2.jpg"><h1>Beginner&apos;s guide to bitcoin</h1><p>&quot;The practical consequence [...is...] for the first time, a way for one Internet user to transfer a unique piece of digital property to another Internet user, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure, everyone knows that the transfer has taken place, and nobody can challenge the legitimacy of the transfer.</p></article>,<p>The following video is slightly technical, but with visualization of how blockchains work and how new entries are posted to the ledger it will give a good understanding of how blockchains work:</p>,<p>I will continue to add links to this post as I find them. In the meantime these are good links to get a basic understanding of the underlying technology for crypto currencies such as Bitcoin.</p>]]></description>
