            <title><![CDATA[Binance Trading View (Basic) - Beginners Guide]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Binance Trading View (Basic) - Beginners Guide</h1>,<p>In this post I will try to give a quick and easy overview of the different elements you will see when you go to the basic Trading View on Binance. In another post I will explain the Advanced Trading View.</p>,<p>I will try to give a short explanation for each of the elements below the picture.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e54fe97e-9de1-4717-9c0e-ee2a1a4f00b3.png" alt="In this post I will try to give a quick and easy overview of the different elements you will see when you go to the basic Trading View on Binance.">,<ol><li>1. You have the option to trade pairs with BTC, ETH, BNB or USDT. USDT is capped to the US $, so they theoretically should have the same value at any given time. This you can use to get an indication on how much your investment is worth at any given moment.</li><li>Once youâ€™ve selected your main coin in step 1 (BTC, ETH, BNB or USDT), you will now be able to select a coin you want to trade your main coin against. In the example you will see that BTC is selected as the main pair, and ADA/BTC is the pair selected.</li><li>Last price is the last traded price. You will eventually see that this matches the last trade in the Trade history (see #9). Since BTC is selected, it is the last price in BTC, it is 0.00002604 satoshi per ADA coin. This is equivalent to approximately $0.48 at the time of this writing.</li><li>Shows you how much the value of ADA has changed in relation to BTC over the past 24 hours. In this example ADA has gained 24% against BTC. This means that if you bad bought ADA for 1BTC 24 hours ago, you would now have 1.24BTC if you sold all your ADA.</li><li>24h High indicates what the highest price has been within the last 24 hours. This can help you get an idea about where the price is exactly when you look at the chart. In this case, it is in fact quite a bit below the highest point within the last 24 hours (1-(0.00002604/0.00003090)= -15.73%).</li><li>24h Low indicates the lowest price the coin has had past 24 hours.</li><li>24h Volume is the total volume that has been traded for this pair. In this case a total worth of 9,764.35402074 BTC has been traded with ADA coin.</li><li>This is the orderbook, and this is where you will see all existing open orders. The ones in red are the open sell orders and the ones below in green are the existing open buy orders. An open sell order means that someone has put their ADA up for sell at a certain price. In this example you will see that the lowest price someone currently are willing to sell ADA for is 0.00002605, while the highest price anyone is willing to pay is 0.00002604. This is also known as the spread. This can be a good indicator for you to see if there is a lot of support for the coin, in case the price drops. This can however be a very tricky indicator because there are so many bot traders, which have algorithms setup to dynamically open and close their buy/sell orders when the market moves. Thus, never solely rely on this when you evaluate whether or not the market is ripe for you to buy/sell. Use it in combination with your regular analysis and long term plan.</li><li>Is the trading history, which shows you the previous orders for ADA/BTC in this example. As you will see the last traded price was 0.00002604, which matches the Last Price up in the left upper corner.</li></ol>]]></description>
