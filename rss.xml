            <title><![CDATA[How to get started with investing in crypto currencies:]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>How to get started with investing in crypto currencies:</h1>,<p>To begin investing in crypto currencies the easiest and most convenient way is creating an account on Coinbase where you can buy either Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin.</p>,<p><strong>Coinbase </strong>â€“ Get $10 worth of BTC when you make your first purchase of any coin for at least $100</p>,<article><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8449722fb335643d47e2923081f73ec5e914101d.jpg"><h1>Coinbase - Buy/Sell Digital Currency</h1><p>Coinbase is a secure online platform for buying, selling, transferring, and storing digital currency.</p></article>,<p>Coinbase lets you invest in the three most popular crypto currencies at the moment, and it is a good way for you to get your feet wet in the crypto investing world. If you want to invest in others of the thousands of crypto currencies available, I recommend signing up for one of the following exchanges.</p>,<p><strong>Binance </strong>â€“ Binance has become my #1 trading platform. They are fast to add new coins, they have a good trading volume, and they have been good at supporting hard forks (what not many exchanges does i.e. Coinbase &amp; Poloniex â€“ this means that you will get free coins when a blockchain is going through a hard fork). Please follow this link to sign up:</p>,<article><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/381e08a9cc6067d75ff4e662dc35243f569f9315.png"><h1>Binance</h1></article>,<p><strong>Poloniex</strong> - My #2 (used to be my #1) trading platform is Poloniex. Poloniex is a well known, high volume US based exchange. They have a number of well established coins a, and a simple to use charting. If you donâ€™t care to invest in newer coins Poloniex will be good for you. Poloniex has to my dissatisfaction NOT been supporting most of the hard forks you might have heard about in the recent weeks (afaik they only supported the Bitcoin Cash hard fork). Poloniex require you to do some verification (e.g. US citizens need to add their SSN).</p>,<p>You can sign up on Poloniex here:</p>,<article><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/720778ea0e58d54270378946712c9892e19472c7.png"><h1>Poloniex - Bitcoin/Digital Asset Exchange</h1><p>Any funds you put into the exchange are only used to facilitate trading through your account. Unlike banks, we do not operate on fractional reserves.</p></article>,<p>In addition to these two exchanges there are a vast number of exchanges out there. There is no harm in signing up to multiple exchanges, so you can sign up to them all and find out, which you like the most. Here is a list of other exchanges that I use more infrequently:</p>,<article><h1>CoinExchange.io - Crypto Currency Altcoin Exchange</h1></article>,<article><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/08b950c15be8bbbe2a55e5e06598012161b939cc.png"><h1>Cryptopia - Home</h1><p>Crypto-Currency Trading, Forum and Marketplace platform.</p></article>,<p>There are many other exchanges out there, but I have only listed the above, because these are the ones I have found to be most trustworthy and in the better end of the security-scale. Remember that in the crypto-world it is almost impossible to guarantee total safety, however there are different steps you can take to prevent hacks and lost coins (money). I will create a post regarding that later, and post the link here.</p>]]></description>
