  Pump&dump (P&D) schemes are a common occurrence in the cryptocurrency world.
  They most often happen in Telegram or Discord (chat programs) groups in which
  several thousand people buy a specific shitcoin (a crypto token without a
  value or future) at the same time in an attempt to artificially inflate its
  value.
