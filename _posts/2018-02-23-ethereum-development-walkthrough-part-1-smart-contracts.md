  Smart contracts, ICOs, Mist, Metamask, Remix, geth, web3.. You've probably

Now, we will deploy it to two kinds of test networks. The tools we will use The most prominent tools at the moments are: Truffle: A development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for Ethereum.</p></article>
