  On September 7th, in partnership with Geektime, we held an hour long
  conference call with four cryptocurrency valuation thought leaders and over
  400 participants. Each speaker shared their perspective on valuing crypto, for
  about 10 minutes each, and then the call was opened for questions from the
  audience.
