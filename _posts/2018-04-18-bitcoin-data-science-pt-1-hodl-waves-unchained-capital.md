  Bitcoin uses a curious accounting structure called a UTXO - an Unspent
  Transaction Output. All UTXOs are timestamped by the transaction/block in
  which they were created. Since all bitcoin in existence is contained in some
  UTXO, this means that all bitcoins have an age: not the age/time when that
  bitcoin was first mined, but when it was last used in a transaction.
