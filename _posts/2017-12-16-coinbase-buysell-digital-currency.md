# How to begin investing in crypto currencies:

## The Easy Way

To begin investing in crypto currencies is in fact very simple. It is almost as easy as placing an order on Amazon or any other online webshop.

The easiest and most convenient way is creating an account on Coinbase where you can buy either Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) or Litecoin (LTC) directly with your credit card, or by sending money to your account via a normal bank transfer.

Coinbase -- 
Coinbase lets you invest in the three most popular crypto currencies at the moment, and it is a good way for you to get your feet wet in the crypto world. 

Use this link when you sign up to **get $10 worth of BTC **when you make your first purchase of any coin for at least $100: [https://www.coinbase.com/join/56c1a428f892ad2729000158][0]

## Exchanges (and a vast number of different crypto currencies)

If you want to invest in others of the thousands of crypto currencies available, I recommend signing up for one of the following exchanges.

If you want to trade other coins that are not on Coinbase you will still need to start with Coinbase. As of now that is one of the only ways to get your money into crypto currencies. In order to start buying and selling a wide variety of crypto currencies I recommend that you buy either BTC or ETH on your newly created Coinbase account. Next you will have to create an account on an exchange. Below is a little introduction to exchanges followed by a guide on how to fund your account on the exchange.

### Binance --

Binance has become my \#1 trading platform. They are fast to add new coins, they have a good trading volume, and they have been good at supporting hard forks (what not many exchanges does i.e. Coinbase & Poloniex -- this means that you will get free coins when a blockchain is going through a hard fork). I recommend that you create an account here as your first exchange. 

Sign up here using my referral link: [https://www.binance.com/?ref=11019906][1]

### Poloniex -

My \#2 (used to be my \#1) trading platform is Poloniex. Poloniex is a well known, high volume US based exchange. They have a number of well established coins a, and a simple to use charting. If you don't care to invest in newer coins Poloniex will be good for you. Poloniex has to my dissatisfaction NOT been supporting most of the hard forks you might have heard about in the recent weeks (afaik they only supported the Bitcoin Cash hard fork). Poloniex require you to do some verification (e.g. US citizens need to add their SSN).

In addition to these two exchanges there are a vast number of exchanges out there. There is no harm in signing up to multiple exchanges, so you can sign up to them all and find out, which you like the most. Here is a list of other exchanges that I use more infrequently:  
[www.coinexchange.io][2][www.cryptopia.co.nz][3][www.bittrex.com][4][www.bitfinex.com][5] (not open US citizens anymore)

There are many other exchanges out there, but I have only listed the above, because these are the ones I have found to be most trustworthy and in the better end of the security-scale. 

## Step-By-Step Guide to Transfer Your Coins to an Exchange

Now that you have an account on both Coinbase and the exchange of your liking I will teach you how to start trading on the exchanges. The following example will use Binance as the example, as that is my favorite exchange, (while it might be slightly different from exchange to exchange the same logic applies to the other exchanges (PM me if you have any questions). The example will also assume that you have bought ETH on Coinbase.

After creating your Binance account (click [here ][6]to create a link) you should (a) login and (b) click on Funds -\> Deposits Withdrawals

You will now get to a new page showing you all your available wallets on Binance:

Since you are now the proud owner of ETH, you want to send some (or all) your ETH to your Binance account. You do this finding Ethereum in the list of wallets, and click on the Deposit button like this:
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bfa01029-72d9-4961-a43f-3dc9c33472b1.png)

You will now see your ETH wallet address that you need to send to from your ETH Account on Coinbase.

Copy the address, and go back to your Coinbase Account and select your ETH Account
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9198abca-ff12-4a83-8487-a7304395358c.png)

As seen below scroll down until you see your ETH Wallet and click on (1) Send. Now you will see a new window open up, and in the (2) Recipient (ETH Address) you paste your Binance ETH Deposit Address that you just copied from your Binance account.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b14ba47a-aac8-4bfe-b1f6-0811f6b68a58.png)

Select the number of ETH you want to send to your Binance account, and in Note (3) I like to put a comment on each transfer I make in order to more easily remember what each transfer was for.

_**Check, Check & Double Check**_ (If you send to the wrong address your coins will be lost) that you have entered the correct ETH address before you click Continue.

> Check, Check & Double Check (If you send to the wrong address your coins will be lost). 

You will get a confirmation when your ETH has been sent. It can take up to several minutes before you will see your ETH on your Binance accunt, depending on how congested the network is. If you have any questions to this feel free to PM me. 

When your ETH gets into your Binance account you are ready to invest in one of the many alt coins that Binance has listed (I will make another post regarding how you trade on Binance -- until then please PM me with any questions). 

Remember that in the crypto-world it is almost impossible to guarantee total safety of your investments, however there are different steps you can take to prevent hacks and lost coins (money). I will create a post regarding that later, and post the link here. 

Until then please PM me for any questions.

Please feel free to message me directly if you have any questions regarding getting started, or you can ask questions below in the comments, and there are probably others who can help you.
