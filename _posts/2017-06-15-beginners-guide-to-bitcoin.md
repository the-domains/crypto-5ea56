**What is Blockchain?**

Bitcoin is on being touted as the new economic foundation, but what is actually making Bitcoin and other crypto currencies work? You might have heard about something called the blockchain. To cut it short a blockchain is a public ledger distributed across a decentralized network of computers.

In this post I have tried to collect a number of useful whitepapers, articles and blogs explaining the Blockchain concept. I hope you will find it useful and learn a thing or two about blockchain technology

The article below from CoinDesk is a good guide for people who wants to know more about bitcoin and blockchain. In the end of this article CoinDesk have provided a number of very useful links for diving deeper into the crypto world.

The following video is a good visualization of how blockchains work and how new entries are posted to the ledger:

I will continue to add links to this post as I find them. In the meantime these are good links to get a basic understanding of the underlying technology for crypto currencies such as Bitcoin.
