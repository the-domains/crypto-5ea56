  As an advisor to the Ethereum project 0x ("zero-ex"), I've spent a lot of time
  thinking about and answering questions about how the technology works and its
  potential impact. Hopefully, this beginner's guide will provide a clear
  introduction to the project and how it will allow anyone in the world to
  operate an exchange for Ethereum tokens.
