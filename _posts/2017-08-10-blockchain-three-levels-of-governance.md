  Distributed ledger technology promises to have far-reaching economic and
  social implications. By leveraging a global peer network to assure directly
  and transparently the integrity of value exchanged between parties, blockchain
  appears likely to transform a number of important industries that supply or
  rely upon third-party assurance. It could prove to be a broader force for
  transparency and integrity in society, including in the fight against bribery
  and corruption. It could also lead to extensive changes in supply chains and
  governmental functions, such as central banking. The extent to which this new
  technology realizes its potential will depend in substantial part upon how
  well stakeholders steward its development. There remain important open
  governance questions regarding both the functioning of the technology and its
  current and potential applications. The World Economic Forum and its new
  Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution is pleased to publish this
  foundational survey of blockchain governance challenges and multistakeholder
  cooperation opportunities. Authored by Don and Alex Tapscott, leading experts
  on both blockchain and multistakeholder governance, this White Paper provides
  a structured analytical framework and taxonomy for use by industry, technical,
  governmental, civil society and other stakeholders in considering how they
  might collaborate to resolve problems and unlock opportunities beyond the
  reach of any single actor.

Distributed ledger technology promises to have far-reaching economic and social implications. By leveraging a global peer network to assure directly and transparently the integrity of value exchanged between parties, blockchain appears likely to transform a number of important industries that supply or rely upon third-party assurance. It could prove to be a broader force for transparency and integrity in society, including in the fight against bribery and corruption. It could also lead to extensive changes in supply chains and governmental functions, such as central banking. The extent to which this new technology realizes its potential will depend in substantial part upon how well stakeholders steward its development. There remain important open governance questions regarding both the functioning of the technology and its current and potential applications. The World Economic Forum and its new Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution is pleased to publish this foundational survey of blockchain governance challenges and multistakeholder cooperation opportunities. Authored by Don and Alex Tapscott, leading experts on both blockchain and multistakeholder governance, this White Paper provides a structured analytical framework and taxonomy for use by industry, technical, governmental, civil society and other stakeholders in considering how they might collaborate to resolve problems and unlock opportunities beyond the reach of any single actor.

As Don and Alex emphasize, a distributed ecosystem need not be a disorganized one, and improved governance need not imply formal governmental legislation or regulation. A cooperative process of multistakeholder dialogue and stewardship can go a long way in improving trust and helping new technological systems develop in a socially beneficial manner. This is the animating purpose of the Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution: to provide an international platform for public-private dialogue and cooperation in respect of the stewardship and agile governance of new technologies. We thank the authors for their contribution, which we believe provides a solid foundation for precisely such a process in respect of blockchain. We also thank members of the World Economic Forum Global Future Council on the Future of Blockchain and others who provided feedback on the White Paper, which expresses the perspectives of the authors alone and not necessarily those of the Forum as an institution or its individual Members and constituents.
