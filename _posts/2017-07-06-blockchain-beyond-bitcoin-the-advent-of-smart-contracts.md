  If the first generation of Blockchain platforms was defined by the
  transaction-based distributed ledgers such as Bitcoin, the next generation is
  clearly defined by the advent of Smart Contracts. Smart Contracts are logic
  written in computer code (in languages such as Solidity, Go, Python, Java)
  that define how and when an agreement will be enforced.
